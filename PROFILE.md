#Hello!
   Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm on a mission to become a frontend developer, and will apprechiate any help and challenge thrown my way. I'm trying to create websites with html, css and javascript at the moment but unsure if I need to use any more programs. Also I'm very unsure how to even use Github still, even with the tutorial finished.
